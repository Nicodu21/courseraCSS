	<h3><a id="target">what AIESEC has been giving to its members :</a></h3>

	<section class="bloc-teamspirit">
	<div class="centered">AIESEC is more than an association, it is an experience. As a matter of fact, AIESECers get to know each other as much as they get to know themselves by living, sharing, learning with another:
	</div>
	</section>
	

<section class="bloc-temoignage">

		<div>
				- Induction Day: this day is the induction process for the new members to introduce them to the AIESEC experience. First impressions are vital to establishing strong relationships between members.</div>

			<div>Anyway, time for our newies to share with you!</div>

				
				<div>- Why did you choose to join AIESEC ?<div>
					<p style="font-style: italic;">
						“When I received the email proposing to apply, I hesitated a lot. I was clearly afraid of being alone in a world I didn't know, but on the one hand, this fear was my new challenge. I also wanted to do something, by which I mean: "to be part of something" and to be able to have new life goals that are more stimulating in the short term than just succeeding in my studies.”
						<span style="font-style:initial; color:#037Ef3;">Chiara di Bernardo</span>
					</p>

				

				<div>- How did you experience Induction day ?</div>
					<p style="font-style:italic;">
						“I immediately felt that this day was fully up to my expectations, I especially perceived that it was much more than an association but really a big family with lots of nice and motivated people who make us want to give the best of ourselves in this adventure.” <span style="font-style:initial; color:#037Ef3;">Lorenzo Bernasconi</span>

					</p>

					

				
			

			<div>- Kick-off: in this event, time to deal with the real purpose of AIESEC! Swiss Local committees gather themselves to talk about the importance of developing leadership skills and improving the SDG's awareness.</div>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">
					"Kick-off is an amazing experience, which allowed us all to get closer! What I also love is the fact that either as a member, a VP, or an LCP, we are still learning! Here is one of the AIESEC strengths, everything is focused on humans and knowledge."<span style="font-style:initial; margin-left: 10px; color:#037Ef3;">Olga Bastiat, Vice-President of Innovation.</span>
				</p>

				<p style="font-style: italic;">
					"Kick-Off 2021 was a really challenging experience for me since it was my first AIESEC national conference as president of LC Lausanne. Fortunately, everything went well and we spent 3 very interesting days where we all learned a lot about AIESEC." <span span style="font-style:initial; margin-left: 10px; color:#037Ef3;">Mélanie Demaurex, Local Comitee President.</span>
				</p>

				<p style="font-style: italic;">
					"As soon as I joined AIESEC, one of the first things I heard was: "conferences are the best things you can attend to in AIESEC". Although Kick-off was online, I had the opportunity to get closer with many people and to learn lots of new skills just like time management or team spirit." <span span style="font-style:initial; margin-left: 10px; color:#037Ef3;">Maher Boukris, Vice-President of Business Development.</span>
				</p>




			<div>-One of Our Alumni also wants to share with you :</div>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">
					"My experience in AIESEC in Lausanne represents an important part of my student life. Indeed, beyond the people I met and the things I was able to learn as a member, My Vice-President position took my AIESEC experience a big step further. Becoming a VP allowed me to work with MY team, take real initiatives and finally learn to assume my entire role as a member of the executive committee." <span span style="font-style:initial; margin-left: 10px; color:#037Ef3;">Mohamed Ayadi, Ex-Vice-President Finance/Legalities.</span>
